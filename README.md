# ls20
Starting anew with a better codebase.

## Ideas
- Use Docker
    - Makes it easy to set up on your computer
- RESTful
    - Use REST the way it's supposed to.
- International
    - Supports many languages
    - (English only until all features finalised)

## Developing
Docker is currently not functioning at this time.
